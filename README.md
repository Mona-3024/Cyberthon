DNS spoofing and Email spoofing Detection Tool
Description
The DNS Spoofing / Email Spoofing Detection Tool is designed to help individuals and organizations detect and prevent spoofing attacks.
DNS Spoofing: A cyberattack where attackers redirect users from legitimate websites to malicious ones by altering the DNS (Domain Name System) records. 
Email Spoofing: A tactic where attackers forge the sender's email address to make it appear as if the email came from a trusted source, often used for phishing or spreading malware. 
This tool will monitor and identify suspicious activities in DNS records or email headers, helping users detect and mitigate spoofing attempts.
